6. About(Short Description/Summary) : This project is all about to develop a simple and efficient multi-utility calculator
                                      application using the concepts of Vedic Mathematics in order to reduce the overhead 
									  of power consumption for running the app in low-powered devices like aakash-2.
									  Arithmetic operations in digital circuitry contributes to most of the power-consumption
									  overhead.So we tried to do a comparative study of the improvement achieved by using the
									  efficient calculation techniques of Vedic Mathematics.
									  
7. Install(Installation Procedure) : Bring the .apk file i.e. calculator.apk in any android-run device and click on it.
                                     Then clicking on the install button,the application will be installed in the device
									 and an icon will be created on the apps-preview window of the device.From that icon,
									 the appplication is ready to run on a single click.
									 
8. Usage : After installation,the app will be running on a single click.On the starting screen,there will be seen different
           buttons to choose from a number of sub-features of the compact application like Standard Calculator,
		   Scientific Calculator,Converter,Alarm,Vedic Multiplication,Vedic Addition etc.Clicking on any one of this button
		   will invoke the corresponding featured application to run and feed user interaction.
